This is based on @grolston/guard-action, which is not using a valid cfn-guard docker image link. My version allows to provide the link as an action input.

# Guard-Action

A simple `GitHub Action` for AWS CloudFormation static code analysis to improve infrastructure-as-code security using AWS cfn-guard.

***The Action does not require AWS credentials!***

It gets better:
**Guard Rules in this github action can be suppressed at the resource-level!** See [Guard Rule Suppression](#guard-rule-suppression) to learn how to leverage in your code.

## Inputs

### `data_directory`

The directory of the repo to scan the cloudformation templates.

### `rule_set`

The AWS Guard rule set used to run security test. Options are:

## Usage

To get started simply add a workflow `.yml` file (name it whatever you would like) to your `.github/workflows` folder. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

## Example

The following example tests CloudFormation with the `FedRAMP-Moderate` example rule set:

```yaml
name: sast

on: [push]

jobs:
  ## Guard rule set FedRAMP-Moderate
  sast-guard:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: grolston/guard-action@main
      with:
        data_directory: './cloudformation/' ## change to your template directory
        rule_set: "FedRAMP-Moderate"
```

The following example tests CloudFormation with the `cis-aws-benchmark-level-1` example rule set:

```yaml
name: sast

on: [push]

jobs:
  ## Guard rule set cis-aws-benchmark-level-1
  sast-guard:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: grolston/guard-action@main
      with:
        data_directory: './cloudformation/' ## change to your template directory
        rule_set: "cis-aws-benchmark-level-1"
```

## Guard Rule Suppression

The rules build in `guard-action` support resource-level rule suppression. Suppressed Rules are marked as SKIP in the validation process. To suppress a rule add in to the resource metadata the following `Metadata`:

**YAML:**
Suppressing rule `EC2_INSTANCE_PROFILE_ATTACHED`
```yaml
Resources:
  ExampleEC2:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Metadata:
      guard:
        SuppressedRules:
        - EC2_INSTANCE_PROFILE_ATTACHED
```

**JSON:**
Suppressing rule `ELASTICSEARCH_ENCRYPTED_AT_REST`
```json
"Resources": {
  "ElasticsearchDomain": {
    "Type": "AWS::Elasticsearch::Domain",
    "Metadata": {
      "guard": {
        "SuppressedRules": ["ELASTICSEARCH_ENCRYPTED_AT_REST"]
      }
    },
    "Properties": {
      "DomainName": "test"
    }
  }
}
```
